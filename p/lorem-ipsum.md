Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:

>Introibo ad altare Dei.

Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:

>Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!
