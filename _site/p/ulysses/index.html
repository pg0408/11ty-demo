        <h1>Ulysses</h1>
        <p>Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introibo ad altare Dei.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!</p>
</blockquote>
